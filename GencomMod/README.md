Scripts for generation of a consensus genome, annotation and associated plots

The code contained within this repository is used for the analysis of illumina reads for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses after the apropiate reference, and bed files are included in the data file, currently just the SARS-CoV-2 data was uploaded.

All suggestions are welcome, actually I am not a coder by formation but for need, so i'm pretty sure these scripts are not the prettiest ones wrote.

Please submit an issue with any requests.
