This folder contains test datasets and sample output summary tables. 

SARS-CoV-2_test_data contains fasta assembly and simulated fastq raw read files for 5 SARS-CoV-2 strains downloaded from NCBI, as well as their region information file. A sample script for analyzing them by MicroGMT is also provided.

E.coli_K12_test_data contains fasta assembly file of 3 randomly selected E.coli K12 strains downloaded from NCBI.

The sample output summary tables contain both types of summary tables, as well as examples of reformatted tables (made by analysis_utilities.py) and example of a table for one extracted strain (made by sequence_ID_extractor.py).

**Note: all the sample outputs were produced by just the 5 randomly selected strains of SARS-CoV-2. So if a mutation is new or unique in the sample output, it may not be new or unique when comparing to all existing SARS-CoV-2 strains.**
